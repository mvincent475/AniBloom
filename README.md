> **Personal deployment:** This repository deploys independently at [anibloom-personal.vercel.app](https://anibloom-personal.vercel.app/). The original open-source project remains at [AniBloomHQ/AniBloom](https://github.com/AniBloomHQ/AniBloom); changes here do not change the upstream deployment.

**AniBloom is a catalog-only addon for Nuvio.** It helps you discover anime through eight standard catalogs, plus two optional extended airing catalogs for upcoming episodes, recently aired episodes, and seasonal releases—including movies.

[Install AniBloom](https://anibloom-personal.vercel.app/manifest.json) · [Homepage](https://anibloom-personal.vercel.app/) · [Support the addon](https://buymeacoffee.com/mark475) · [Releases](https://github.com/mvincent475/AniBloom/releases)

## What AniBloom is

AniBloom brings these eight catalogs together in one list:

- **Upcoming 3 days** — Anime with new episodes airing in the next 3 days.
- **Previous 3 days** — Anime that aired in the last 3 days.
- **Current Season** — Anime in the current season.
- **Current Season Movies** — Movies from the current season.
- **Previous Season** — Anime from the recently ended season.
- **Previous Season Movies** — Movies from the recently ended season.
- **Upcoming Season** — Anime from the next upcoming season.
- **Upcoming Season Movies** — Movies from the next upcoming season.

The optional **extended** setup adds two more catalogs (using Japan's broadcast calendar for the Airing Today cutoff):

- **Airing Today** — Upcoming episodes through midnight in Japan Standard Time (JST, UTC+9).
- **Upcoming 7 days** — Anime with new episodes over the next seven rolling days.

To avoid additional requests for existing installations, the standard manifest continues to expose only the original eight catalogs. The homepage lists **Airing Today** and **Upcoming 7 days** separately under **Optional extended catalogs**, with links to their extended catalog endpoints. These previews do not silently enable the catalogs in the standard manifest; select the extended installation option to include them.

## What AniBloom is not

AniBloom is not a streaming service, media host, or metadata provider. It does not host, store, stream, or distribute anime. It also does not provide detailed metadata such as descriptions, artwork, or episode information.

Install a separate compatible metadata provider in Nuvio to supply detailed title information and artwork. Examples include **ioametadata**, **Xperience**, and **BingeCat**.

### P1 discovery options

The six seasonal series/movie catalogs advertise a fixed selection of optional genres. When supported by the Nuvio client, selecting a genre filters AniList results before pagination; direct catalog requests can also include `genre=Action`. Unfiltered catalogs behave as before. Title searches support English, Romaji, Native and AniList synonym titles, including common accents and punctuation variations. AniList still controls the upstream search candidate set.

**Resource considerations:** Extended feeds are opt-in. The new seven-day feed may consume more AniList schedule pages than the existing three-day feed. Each request remains bounded to eight schedule pages, so a busy week may show an incomplete list. Do not assume this feed is an exhaustive schedule.

### P2 discovery and artwork options (opt-in)

The **Top Anime of the Season** catalog is an optional popularity-ranked view. Existing standard and extended catalogs stay unchanged. Use **Top Season** on the homepage or add `/ranked` immediately before `/manifest.json` to the chosen manifest URL; for example `/romaji/extended/ranked/manifest.json` includes both optional additions.

Catalogs also support an optional **Artwork** filter: **AniList** (default), **BetterPosters**, or **PostersPlus**. Alternative artwork comes directly from the selected external poster provider when compatible; otherwise AniBloom keeps its existing cover. Some Nuvio clients may not expose optional catalog extras. A separately configured public PostersPlus service is required; none is configured by default. These are catalog-preview posters, not detail-page artwork replacements.

Alternative artwork does not create extra AniBloom image requests or change shared catalog data. Live Nuvio compatibility, image availability and production resource impact remain unverified until the Vercel quota issue is resolved. [See setup details and limitations](docs/p2-enhancements.md).

## Installation

1. Open the AniBloom [homepage](https://anibloom-personal.vercel.app/).
2. Select **Add to Nuvio**, or copy the manifest URL below into Nuvio.

```text
https://anibloom-personal.vercel.app/manifest.json
```

For manual installation, use the same manifest URL.

### Anime title preferences

Choose a display style and optionally enable extended airing and Top Season catalogs on the homepage. The existing six standard/extended combinations remain unchanged:

| Preference | Standard (8 catalogs) | Extended (10 catalogs) | Catalog names |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| English (default) | `/manifest.json` | `/extended/manifest.json` | English |
| Romaji | `/romaji/manifest.json` | `/romaji/extended/manifest.json` | English |
| Native | `/native/manifest.json` | `/native/extended/manifest.json` | Japanese |

All paths above are relative to `https://anibloom-personal.vercel.app`. The homepage updates the installation URL when you enable extended airing and/or Top Season. For ranked variants, add `/ranked` before `/manifest.json`; for example, `/romaji/extended/ranked/manifest.json` exposes all eleven optional catalogs. These variants are fixed public routes, not per-user accounts.

English titles fall back to Romaji, then Native; Romaji titles fall back to English, then Native; Native titles fall back to Romaji, then English. Native means the original writing system (not always Japanese).

All variants retain the same eight standard catalog IDs; extended variants add two fixed airing IDs and ranked variants add one fixed Top Season ID. Media identities, search, pagination, and upstream processing are shared. No user accounts, unique manifests, or server-side language preferences are created. Nuvio may treat each URL as a separate installation: remove the old variant when switching to avoid duplicates. Nuvio or a separate metadata provider may override titles shown on detail pages; AniBloom controls its catalog responses, not Nuvio's application language.


## Personal deployment setup

See [Personal deployment checklist](docs/personal-deployment.md) for this fork's GitHub and Vercel configuration, deployment protection, distributed rate limiting, and isolated release process.

## Self-hosting

You can run your own AniBloom instance instead of using the public deployment. The project supports local development with its included Node.js preview server and deployment to your own Vercel project.

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- Git

### Option 1: Run locally

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvincent475/AniBloom.git
   cd AniBloom
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the local server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server listens on port `3000` by default. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the homepage.

   To use a different port, set the `PORT` environment variable before starting the server. For example:

   ```bash
   PORT=8080 npm run dev
   ```

4. Use your local manifest URL in Nuvio:

   ```text
   http://localhost:3000/manifest.json
   ```

   If Nuvio runs on a different device, `localhost` refers to that device—not the computer hosting AniBloom. In that case, use the host computer's reachable LAN address and ensure its firewall allows the chosen port. Only expose the server to networks you trust.

The local preview server implements the homepage, manifest, version, catalog, and static asset routes. It is intended for local use and development; use the Vercel deployment option below for a public, serverless instance.

### Option 2: Deploy to your own Vercel project

1. Create or sign in to a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup).
2. Install the Vercel CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install --global vercel
   ```

3. Clone the repository if you have not already, then open its directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvincent475/AniBloom.git
   cd AniBloom
   ```

4. Link the local project to a new Vercel project and follow the prompts:

   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

   Choose or create the Vercel project you want to use. Keep the project root directory set to the repository root. AniBloom uses the included `vercel.json` rewrites and `api/` serverless functions; do not set a separate output directory.

5. Deploy a preview to verify the setup:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

6. When the preview works, deploy to production:

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

7. Copy your deployment's manifest URL into Nuvio:

   ```text
   https://YOUR-VERCEL-DOMAIN/manifest.json
   ```

   Replace `YOUR-VERCEL-DOMAIN` with the domain assigned to your Vercel project or a custom domain you have configured.

### Optional environment variable

Set `DONATION_URL` in your Vercel project's environment variables to configure the homepage's **Support development** link. The value must be an HTTPS URL. If it is missing or invalid, the homepage falls back to `https://buymeacoffee.com/mark475`. Configure the variable separately for each environment where you want a custom destination.

Vercel may ask you to confirm project settings during the first deployment. Use the repository root, Node.js 20 or newer, and no custom build or output directory unless Vercel's current project setup specifically requires otherwise. Review your own Vercel plan's function, bandwidth, and usage limits; those limits and any associated costs are controlled by your account.

### Keeping your instance updated

To update your self-hosted copy, pull the latest changes from the repository:

```bash
git pull
npm install
```

For a local instance, restart the server after updating. For Vercel, run `vercel --prod` again from the linked project directory after pulling the changes.

## Support the upstream public instance

The public AniBloom instance is currently hosted on Vercel's **Hobby plan**. Its resource and usage limits may affect response times or availability during periods of higher traffic.

If community donations become sufficient, I may move the public instance to a higher Vercel plan for more generous resource and usage limits. An upgrade may help accommodate more traffic, although it cannot guarantee faster responses in every situation.

If AniBloom is useful to you, you can support its ongoing maintenance and hosting through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mark475). Donations are optional. You can also use the self-hosting instructions above and run your own instance.

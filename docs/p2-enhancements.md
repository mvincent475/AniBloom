# Unified catalogs, ranked discovery, and artwork setup

> **AniBloom Personal release tracking:** These unified catalog and BetterPosters features are integrated into the v2.18.0 personal codebase. The verified production version and deployment are recorded in `ops/release-state.json`; a source merge alone is not a production release. The upstream project's deployment status and resource limits are independent.

## 1. All 11 catalogs in the default manifest

The canonical `/manifest.json` (and the Romaji and Native variants) advertises **all eleven** catalog IDs in this order: `upcoming_season`, `current_season`, `previous_season`, `upcoming_season_movies`, `current_season_movies`, `previous_season_movies`, `upcoming_3_days`, `previous_3_days`, `airing_today`, `upcoming_7_days`, and `top_season`.

The previous `/extended` and `/ranked` paths, including combined and language-prefixed paths, remain functional **aliases** yielding identical 11-catalog manifests. They should not be installed alongside the canonical manifest because Nuvio may display duplicate addon rows. Old installations may need a manifest refresh or remove/reinstall after deployment.

For visibility control, use Nuvio Web **Settings → Home** (per-catalog show/hide and reorder) or the equivalent **Catalog Customization / Reorder Home Catalogs** on supported Nuvio TV/mobile builds. These settings can affect catalog availability beyond the Home screen on some clients, and a manifest containing additional catalog IDs may cause extra startup requests before users disable rows. Disabling Home rows is **not** a guarantee of zero external requests in all clients. Primary references: [Nuvio Web Home settings](https://orochibraru.com/nuvio-web/docs/profiles-and-settings) and [Nuvio TV catalog controls / platform caveat](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTV/issues/3478).

Top Season uses the current Japanese calendar season (`Asia/Tokyo`) and upstream AniList sorting `POPULARITY_DESC, SCORE_DESC, ID`. That is *AniList list popularity*, not editorial quality. It requests exactly one 50-item AniList season page before existing provider-identity processing. Airing Today ends at Japan's next midnight; Upcoming 7 Days covers a rolling 168 hours and retains the existing eight-page schedule query cap. Normalized catalog response keys remain partitioned by catalog ID/season/search/genre. Fetch limits, stale caches, shared AniList budgets, and safety guards remain in place.

## 2. BetterPosters: automatic catalog artwork

**No BetterPosters configuration is required in AniBloom or Nuvio.** The normal canonical manifest is the sole recommended installation path; users only choose their desired *catalog title preference* (English/Romaji/Native).

| Catalog title preference | Canonical manifest | BetterPosters poster text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| English | `/manifest.json` | English (default; no `lang` parameter) |
| Romaji | `/romaji/manifest.json` | English (default; no `lang` parameter) |
| Native | `/native/manifest.json` | Japanese (`?lang=ja`) |

For an eligible IMDb title (`tt` followed by 7–12 digits), AniBloom constructs direct client-side URLs such as `https://btttr.cc/poster/imdb/poster-default/tt1234567.jpg`. Native catalog URLs append `?lang=ja`. AniBloom **does not call the provider or proxy the image**; Nuvio loads it from BetterPosters itself.

We confirmed the provider URL-builder contract against [BetterPosters' published source and unit tests](https://github.com/neurekadev/better-posters/blob/master/BetterPosters/BetterPosterUrlBuilder.cs). Its standard visual options are:

| Option | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Trend tags | On |
| Genre label | On |
| Rating label | On |
| Rating source | Average |
| Quality tags | Off |
| Age-rating tags | Off |
| Language | English for English/Romaji; Japanese for Native |

The URL builder retains the provider's known switch combinations for future code-level use: toggling genre/rating selects `poster`, `poster-r`, `poster-g`, or `poster-n`; quality tags append `q`; age rating appends `a`; disabling trend tags sets `tag=none`; a supported specific rating source uses `rs=...`. These are **not** configurable from the AniBloom homepage. Only the poster language follows the selected manifest language automatically.

### Identity, fallback, and backward compatibility

- Only finalized **IMDb-format catalog IDs** use BetterPosters; other IDs (MAL, AniList, TMDB, etc.) keep their original AniList `extraLarge → large → medium` cover, so cached canonical identities are not altered or guessed.
- A correctly formed BetterPosters URL is **not** guaranteed to resolve to an existing image. If the external service responds with 404, blocks or rate-limits a client, AniBloom cannot substitute the original image after returning its catalog JSON; Nuvio or a separately installed metadata addon controls on-device fallback and detail-page posters.
- Existing explicit provider-specific manifest paths and `artwork` query parameters remain accepted as compatibility interfaces to avoid breaking current installations, but the UI and canonical manifest **do not advertise provider setup or a per-catalog artwork selector**. For new users, no extra configuration is required.
- No credentials, cookies, private addon manifests, API keys, arbitrary custom hostnames or per-user state are supplied to BetterPosters; images are loaded directly by the Nuvio client.

## 3. Performance and release policy

Default manifest expansion from eight to eleven IDs is a deliberate product change: it **does not perform all eleven upstream requests merely to render the HTML homepage or manifest**, but Nuvio may request newly advertised rows immediately. This can increase total AniList queries, mapping work, Vercel CPU and error rate, including `ANILIST_RATE_LIMIT_BUDGET`. Turning off unwanted rows may mitigate traffic but is client-dependent. The two rolling schedules still have a bounded eight-page cap, `top_season` one AniList page per request, with existing shared cache and limiter. Automatic BetterPosters projection does not add server-side upstream requests.

No new dependencies, cron jobs, production probes, telemetry or paid services. Performance/cost validation comprises offline regression tests of page bounds and cache isolation; **real production CPU savings or Nuvio startup traffic are not measured**. Keep observability #511 deferred; do not reinstate scheduled production monitoring to validate this change. After a user-authorized release, verify default/legacy manifests, per-row client toggles, provider poster requests, and request budgets before revising resource policy.

For AniBloom Personal, release metadata is updated only after the verified controlled production release and smoke tests. Use `ops/release-state.json` as the authoritative deployment record. Deployments are gated by the protected GitHub Actions workflow and personal project credentials.
